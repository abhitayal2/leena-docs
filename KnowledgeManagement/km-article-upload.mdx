This document describes the step by step process for uploading and publishing any article in Knowledge Management Dashboard.

1. Go to KM dashboard \> go to Articles page \> click on Add New button. 

   Here in the root category called "All categories", users can add their folder structure by adding "categories"

   \!
2. After adding categories, users can go inside category and click on the Add New button.

   Here users will get 5 options -

   a. Folder - This option is used to add sub-categories

   b. Article - This option is used to add or create articles in KM dashboard from scratch in text editor.

   c. Web article - This option is used to add web page articles in KM.

   Note - Web article will not fetch content from the child pages of provided url. For fetching all the child pages, we have another feature called “Web Integrations”    which can be accessed via KM settings page.

   d. Upload Article - This option is used to upload pdf, docx, excel, jpeg, png, csv and ppt files.

   e. Bulk upload - This option is used to upload multiple pdf, docx, excel, jpeg, png, csv and ppt files.

3. For uploading the document, users can fill in the below form, upload the file and create an article.

4. Once the document is uploaded in the KM dashboard in “Draft”, we “Parse” the document i.e we fetch out the content from the uploaded document. Parsing is the process of fetching html content from the documents. Leena AI uses the PDF Parser models for this process. Hence, we convert uploaded docx, ppt files into PDF and then process them using PDF Parser. 

   Note - Images, Written Articles and Web Articles are not parsed. Excels and CSVs are converted into SQL database.

   In the "Draft" state - users can view and edit upload document (edit content is only for pdf), view and edit parsed content, view and edit details, FAQs and audiences.

   \!
5. Once the draft is ready for publish, users can move the article to “In-Review” state by defining the article approvers.

   \!
6. Once the article is sent to “In-Review” state, the approvers will receive a notification and they will come to KM dashboard and approve the article. They can go to the “Home” page and check for in-review article in the kanban board and approve or reject it.

   \!

Note - If the approver approves the article, it will be moved to “Published” state. If the approver rejects the article, it will be moved back to the “draft” state. In both the cases, the article owner will be notified accordingly.

7. Once the article has been published, a sync will run with the virtual assistant. During this sync, the newly published changes will be synced with Leena AI’s internal services of NLP and Core. Users can monitor the sync status in the top right section of KM dashboard.
